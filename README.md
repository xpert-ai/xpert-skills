# Skills

Public repository for Skills of Xpert platform.
Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that Xpert loads dynamically to improve performance on specialized tasks. Skills teach Xpert how to complete specific tasks in a repeatable way, whether that's creating documents with your company's brand guidelines, analyzing data using your organization's specific workflows, or automating personal tasks.

# About This Repository

This repository contains skills that demonstrate what's possible with Xpert's skills system. These skills range from creative applications (art, music, design) to technical tasks (testing web apps, MCP server generation) to enterprise workflows (communications, branding, etc.).

Each skill is self-contained in its own folder with a `SKILL.md` file containing the instructions and metadata that Xpert uses. Browse through these skills to get inspiration for your own skills or to understand different patterns and approaches.

## Disclaimer

**These skills are provided for demonstration and educational purposes only.** While some of these capabilities may be available in Xpert, the implementations and behaviors you receive from Xpert may differ from what is shown in these skills. These skills are meant to illustrate patterns and possibilities. Always test skills thoroughly in your own environment before relying on them for critical tasks.

# Creating a Basic Skill

Skills are simple to create - just a folder with a `SKILL.md` file containing YAML frontmatter and instructions. You can use the **template-skill** in this repository as a starting point:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill-name
description: A clear description of what this skill does and when to use it
---

# My Skill Name

[Add your instructions here that Xpert will follow when this skill is active]

## Examples
- Example usage 1
- Example usage 2

## Guidelines
- Guideline 1
- Guideline 2
```

The frontmatter requires only two fields:
- `name` - A unique identifier for your skill (lowercase, hyphens for spaces)
- `description` - A complete description of what the skill does and when to use it

The markdown content below contains the instructions, examples, and guidelines that Xpert will follow. For more details, see [How to create custom skills](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512198-creating-custom-skills).
